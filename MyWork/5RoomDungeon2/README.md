The "5 Room Dungeon 2" is a fairly simple game.
When you start you get to enter a room and something or nothing might happen...
You get to explore 5 rooms before you have to face the boss.
Everytime you encounter an inhabitant of the dungeon you will have to fight.
A fight is just rock paper scissors
If you tie, the fight becomes more epic and the steaks are raised (that means you get more points for winning the fight)
If you find treasure you get a flat 50 points to your score.
If you defeat the boss at the end you get 200 points to your score and win the game.
GOOD LUCK EXPLORING!
